## Features

### Existing Features

-   __F01 Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all pages of the website supporting easy navigation.  It includes a Logo image combined with a simple text logo, and menu items - Home page, Features and Sign up links. The Features link has a drop down menu to the different feature pages. This drop down list updates on each feature page to remove the page that you are currently on to improve navigation across the website without the user needing to return to the homepage to access the different feature pages. The nav bar is responsive on multiple screen sizes. On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the Home, Menu and Contact links move to under the Logo.

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119696542/212703501-7187d619-532d-4d16-bbd6-66976d3c1c5c.png)
    

-   __F02 Landing Page image__

    - The landing page includes a hero image and a text overlay that together clearly identify the purpose of the website and the type of content that can be expected.  The earth tones are used to relate the website with nature.

    - A large quote below the hero image is used to emphasise the impact of sharing the sustainable lifestyle journey.

      ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119696542/212703622-6a7e74e7-2d42-43be-9a6c-64a6e6946ea8.png)

- __F03 Feature buttons__

    - There are currently 6 feature buttons on the landing page which are labelled to identify the content that can be found when clicked. The feature buttons "light up" when you hover over each one to add some interactivity with the website. They also have shadow applied to help them stand out on the white background. Text colour is kept simple with added shadown to improve readability and to minimise distraction.

     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119696542/212703699-5a2df2a1-4981-4c5a-a984-2e6c06c1de22.png)

- __F04 Footer__

    - The footer is featured on all pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.  It contains two sections :

    - Follow us - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As Sustainability Ireland is a ficticious company, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

    - Disclaimer - notify any users that this website has been created as part of the Code Institute diploma.

- __F05 Feature Pages - 'Features' section__

    - The feature pages provide information relevant to the section that the user has clicked on. There is a heading at the top of the page to show what feature page the user is on. 
    
	- There is also a background image which matches the image of the feature button on the homepage. Certain text is in bold to make the text more understandable at a quick glance.

     ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119696542/212704596-5284f645-ca74-4bfc-a018-139d3db43d16.png)


- __F06 Sign up page - 'Sign up'__

	- This page will allow the user to get signed up to Sustainability Ireland monthly newsletter to continue their sustainable lifestyle journey. The user will be able specify what categories they are interested in, along with a free text field to enter "Other" interests, to help support the development of features in the future. The user will be asked to submit their full name and email address as a requirement to submit the form.

- __F07 Thank you page - 'Thank you'__

	- This page has been created and will be displayed to users who successfully submit the sign up form so that they know the form has been submitted. I have not directed the form to this page at this time so that the assesor will be able to verify that the form is working correctly and the inputted information is sent across.

- __F08 404 error page - '404 Error'__

	- This page has been created and will be displayed to users who manage to navigate to a page that doesn't exist. They will be able to navigate to any other page of the website from the nav bar.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119696542/213731343-9cf84e64-148f-47f4-9a47-88d92669fe68.png)


### Features which could be implemented in the future

- __New Feature pages__
    - New feature categories can be added so that returning users continue to learn from the information provided.

- __Community boards__
    - Users can sign up to be part of the Sustainability Ireland community and post questions to a board which other community members will be able to post answers to.
    
- __Search function in the nav bar__
    - A search function would enable users to quickly find particular information that they are looking for.
    
- __Resources section__
    - A resources section would enable users to navigate to external websites to gain further knowledge from sustainability experts.
    
- __Archive section__
    - An archive section would be useful to move old information to so that the feature sections can be updated and kept relevant without losing old feature info.

### Accessibility

- Aria labels used on homepage Feature buttons to ensure visually impaired users know what the buttons do.

## Design

-   ### Logo
    -   The logo was created on freelogodesign.org website. The circular swirl was chosen as it ties in with the sustainability ethos of a circular economy. This is combined with the text logo at the top right of the website which users will naturally read first.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119696542/213275773-226014a8-b06d-49e3-b4da-69017430e328.png)

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero image and the “Sign Up” page background image have been chosen because they support the mission of the website and use natural tones.  The images are not busy so do not distract from the text or interfere with the readability.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A dark green colour (#3a4139) was selected to keep the overall feel neutral and also to be a good contrast with the white logo and menu items. The website only uses one main colour as the feature buttons on the homepage each have a unique background image which has the potential to clash if the website had a background color so the background is just white. The background on the feature pages also uses images so there is not a requirement to select multiple colours across the website. This maintains a simple clean display across the website.

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Montserrat font into styles.css.  This was chosen to maintain a simple and modern feel that is easy to read throughout the site.

 ### Lighthouse
 
 - I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website. I updated all images to webp format to improve the performance score

 ### Known bugs

- While testing on iphone, it has been recorded that the “Reset form” button on the Sign up form appears with rounded edges rather than the rectangle that it should be. Functionally it still works and further investigation is required to resolve.
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/119696542/213687296-008920a8-6ff2-4d14-aa09-72464e8e508b.png)

- The website was reviewed by a family member and the quote on the homepage was not displayed as it should be (on 2 lines with the name below the quote). I have been unable to replicate this using dev tools so noting it here as a known bug.
