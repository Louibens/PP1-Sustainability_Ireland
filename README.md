## Features

### Existing Features

-   __F01 Navigation Bar__

    - The navigation bar has a consistent look and placement on all pages of the website supporting easy navigation.  It includes a Logo image combined with a simple text logo, and menu items - Home page, Features and Sign up links. The Features link has a drop down menu to the different feature pages. This drop down list updates on each feature page to remove the page that you are currently on. It is responsive on multiple screen sizes. On small screens (e.g. mobile devices) the Home, Menu and Contact links move to under the Logo.

-   __F02 Landing Page image__

    - The landing page includes a hero image and a text overlay that together clearly identify the purpose of the website and the type of content that can be expected.  The earth tones are used to relate the website with nature.

    - A large quote below the hero image is used to emphasise the impact of sharing the sustainable lifestyle journey.

- __F03 Feature buttons__

    - There are currently 6 feature buttons on the landing page which are labelled to identify the content that can be found when clicked. The feature buttons "light up" when you hover over each one to add some interactivity with the website. Text colour is kept simple with added shadown to improve readability and to minimise distraction.

- __F04 Footer__

    - The footer is featured on all pages and is identical on each page making it easy to use.  It contains two sections :

    - Follow us - this area has links to social media sites associated with the organisation encouraging the user to keep connected.  The links will open in a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. The organisation can use these sites to promote brand awareness and keep customers interested through updates, offers, chats and other marketing efforts. (As Sustainability Ireland is a ficticious company, the links currently just go to the social media main websites.)

    - Disclaimer - notify any users that this website has been created as part of the Code Institute diploma.

- __F06 Feature Pages - 'Features' section__

    - The feature pages provide information relevant to the section that the user has clicked on. There is a heading at the top of the page to show what feature page the user is on. 
    
- There is also a background image which matches the image of the feature button on the homepage. Certain text is in bold to make the text more understandable at a quick glance.

    - New feature categories can be added so that returning users continue to learn from the information provided.


## Design

-   ### Imagery
    -   The hero image and the “Sign Up” page background image have been chosen because they support the mission of the website and use natural tones.  The images are not busy so do not distract from the text or interfere with the readability.

-   ### Colour Scheme
    -  A dark green colour was selected to keep the overall feel neutral and also to be a good contrast with the white logo and menu items.

-   ### Typography
    -   Google Fonts were used to import Montserrat font into styles.css.  This was chosen to maintain a simple and modern feel that is easy to read throughout the site.
