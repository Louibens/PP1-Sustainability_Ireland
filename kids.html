                As an expecting or new parent you are busy getting everything ready and your babies well being is your main priority. It is a magical time filled with lots of new things. <strong>Lots!</strong> You will be looking for new baby furniture, clothes and nappies and all sorts of other baby related products. Keep an eco-friendly mindset to <strong>avoid waste where possible</strong>. 
                </div>
                <div class="info-box"> 
                It is common to start thinking more about the future when you have kids. It is our children who have the most to gain from us taking sustainable steps and it is important to <strong>teach the next generation</strong> how to look after their environment. 
                </div>
                <div class="info-box"> 
                Do you have any family or friends who have any baby items that they are finished with? <strong>Free-cycle sites</strong> are also a great place to find baby furniture, a lot of the time for free! Having a baby is expensive but you can keep costs down by sourcing products this way. You can then also pass the items that you no longer need to someone who does need them. 
                </div>
                <div class="info-box"> 
                Kids grow fast and buying new clothes can cost fortunes so accepting hand-me-downs is a great way to <strong>save money</strong> but also to save the clothes from going to landfill. <strong>Win - Win</strong>
                </div>
                <div class="info-box"> 
                A baby can use between 2,000 and 2,200 nappies in their first year. Save your pocket and the planet and try cloth nappies. 
                </div> 
                <div class="info-box"> 
                As your kid grows teach them how to live a sustainable lifestyle. Bring a litter picker with you when you go for a walk. Take them to the zero waste shop. Ask for their help to sort old clothes or toys that can be passed on.
