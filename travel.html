            Tourism is responsible for roughly <strong>8%</strong> of the world's carbon emissions, according to a study published by the University of Sydney. No matter how sustainable your travel habits are, certain carbon emissions are unavoidable.
        <div class="divider"></div>
            A <strong>"staycation"</strong> is one of the most sustainable tourism options you can make and eliminate unnecessary flights when possible. 
            We often take for granted what we have on our doorstep. We are so fortunate to have some of the most beautiful landscapes to explore here in Ireland. Think about how you are going to travel and take public transport where possible or go on a group trip.
            France has recently banned short haul domestic flights in favour of train travel in an effort to reduce carbon emmissions. 
            <div class="divider"></div>
            When researching your next trip, look for businesses that have implemented <strong>green policies</strong> that can include environmental, social and local economic impacts.
            It is worth checking with hotels to see what commitments they have in place that support their local community and the fair employment of local people.
            Don't forget to bring your reusable bottles and bags to avoid creating unnecessary waste!
            <div class="divider"></div>
            While on your trip it is important to <strong>support local</strong> producers and gifted craftspeople along with respecting the traditions, culture and customs of a place.
            Shop in small businesses, and eat locally sourced food and drink.
