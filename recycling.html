                </div>
                <div class="info-box"> 
                We once saw recycling as the answer to our increasing waste issues however unfortunately recycling is not the solution. The best thing you can do is avoid products that will end up being thrown out where possible - I'm looking at you single use plastics
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">
                Here are a few facts to help us understand the scale of the issue...
                    <ul>
                        <li>It takes up to <strong>500 years</strong> for plastic to decompose.</li>
                        <li>When you recycle one single glass bottle, enough energy is saved to illuminate a 100-watt light bulb for four hours or power a computer or television for close to half an hour. (Source: mywaste.ie)</li>
                        <li>Only about 30% of all plastics are recycled in Ireland. Consumers need to ensure that they properly sort their recycling items and that they are clean. Recycling that includes non-recyclable items or is contaminated with food waste can end up in landfill. </li>
                        <li>More Than <strong>8 million Tonnes of Plastic</strong> enter the oceans <strong>every year</strong>. (Source: earth.org)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div> 
                <div class="info-box">
                With stats like that get yourself <strong>reusable items</strong> that will help you avoid generating the waste in the first place. 
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">
                <img src="assets/images/green-dot.jpg" alt="green dot recycling symbol">
                <br>
                This is called the <strong>Green Dot</strong>, it is one of the most widely used recycling symbols on packaging and therefore causes the most confusion.
                Its usage means that the producer of the packaging has contributed to the end recovery of the packaging, in Ireland this scheme is Repak.
                The Green Dot is not in itself a recycling symbol nor does it mean that the packaging material on which it is marked is either recycled, or made using recyclable content. It is more a mark of the producer's environmental responsibility and contribution to recycling.
