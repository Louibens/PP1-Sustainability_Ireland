                There are so many areas where you can make small sustainable changes around the house. It is a great starting point on your sustainable lifestyle journey. There are plenty of <strong>alternatives</strong> that make the change easy such as bamboo toothbrushes to replace plastic ones. How many toothbrushes does your family get through in one year? Another great bathroom switch you can make is shampoo and conditioner bars to replace the plastic bottles.

                There are lots of brilliant <strong>zero waste grocery shops</strong> popping up around the country. You can bring your empty containers and fill them up with the amount that you require. These shops are also great for <strong>supporting local suppliers</strong>. They generally stock organic fruit and veg, cleaning products to personal hygiene products. You won't be disappointed after a trip to your nearest zero waste store. They have done a lot of the heavy lifting, making it really easy for you to make eco friendly choices.

                <strong>Water usage</strong> is another way you can move to a more sustainable way of life. *Average daily water consumption in Ireland is approximately 148 litres per person per day. Water is a limited resource that we need to be mindful of. You could keep a water container outside to collect rainwater to feed your houseplants. Reduce your time in the shower. Turn off the tap while you're brushing your teeth or shaving. Fill the dishwasher before putting it on.
