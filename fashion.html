                There are so many <strong>shocking facts</strong> related to the fashion industry such as how textile production contributes more to climate change than international aviation and shipping combined with clothing companies creating more than <strong>1 million garments every day</strong>. *Source info from Oxfam.org. It is all a bit overwhelming. We are going to focus on actions that you can take to lessen your impact and hopefully we can encourage others to take action too. Step 1 - <strong>think</strong> about how the items is produced! How can a company produce an item of clothing that you can buy for a fiver???? Something doesn’t add up.

                <div class="info-box"> 
                The action that makes the biggest impact is to <strong>reduce</strong> your consumption. We are constantly bombarded with adverts that makes us feel like we need the latest trends. Ask yourself whether you need something before purchasing. Then look at buying from <strong>vintage</strong> and/or charity shops. <strong>Repair</strong> clothes that could avoid being dumped.
                </div>
                <div class="info-box">   
                According to a 2019 UN report, "<strong>every second</strong> an amount of textiles equivalent to a garbage truck is buried or burnt"

                <strong>Avoid fast fashion</strong> brands that produce low quality clothes that will result in your dumping more and needing to purchase more often. Better quality items will last longer. *Extending the life of clothes by just 9 months of active use would reduce carbon, water and waste footprints by 20-30% each *Source info from Oxfam.org.

                <div class="info-box"> 
                Look into the practises of fast fashion companies that are involved in <strong>unethical</strong> practices such as underpaid labour, exploitation and the use of toxic chemicals in their clothing. In 2022, Channel 4 documentary, UNTOLD, exposed the “inhuman” working conditions at the worlds most popular fast-fashioin clothing brand - Shein.  Think about who made your clothes…

                <div class="info-box"> 
                It is common practise these days when purchasing clothes online to buy the same item in multiple sizes and return the items that don't fit. Unfortunately, fast-fashion brands are reportedly dumping a high percentage of these items as the cost involved in the return process is too expensive, particularly when the item was sold for cheap in the first place.
