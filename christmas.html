                A lot of wrapping paper cannot be recycled. Check that you are buying a recyclable wrapping paper or get creative and use old newspapers, brown paper or fabric that can be used again and again. When throwing wrapping out you can check if it can be recycled by scrunching it. If it scrunches up into a ball you can put that in the recycle bin but unfortunately a lot of wrapping paper is made with plastic so if it doesn't scrunch you can't recycle it, could it be reused? * recyclenow.com/recycle-an-item/wrapping-paper

                Everyone loves giving and getting gifts but no one wants to give someone something they don't want. Think about what does the gift receiver <strong>need</strong>, what about gifting experiences or a meal in a local restaurant. <strong>Shop local</strong> from small businesses as much as possible. They need your support to survive.

                A real tree vs a fake tree. <strong>Rent a tree.</strong> A real tree is the best option and there are now companies that allow you to rent a tree and you can then bring it back for it to be replanted and you can rent it again the next year. If you prefer a fake tree, you can source second-hand ones from freecycle pages.
